# Self-Hosted Video Conferencing: Implementing ECS Express Mode for Jitsi Meet

## Introduction

**December 2025 Update**: We fully implemented AWS ECS Express Mode for our Jitsi video platform, achieving simplified production-ready deployment with zero additional cost. This article documents our implementation journey and the operational benefits we gained.

When we first deployed Jitsi Meet on AWS, we built it the traditional way: hand-crafted Terraform configurations, custom security groups, detailed VPC networking, and a Network Load Balancer setup that required meticulous configuration. It worked perfectly and remains well-architected.

Six months later, when ECS Express Mode was announced, we evaluated whether to migrate. After careful analysis, we decided to **fully implement Express Mode** while preserving our scale-to-zero architecture and operational control. This article documents what we learned and how we achieved production-ready deployment with minimal configuration overhead.

## What is ECS Express Mode?

ECS Express Mode is AWS's simplified approach to container orchestration. Rather than managing individual resources, you declare what you want and let AWS handle the infrastructure.

### Core Benefits of ECS Express Mode

| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Simplified Deployment** | Requires only a container image, task execution role, and infrastructure role. No manual load balancer, IAM, or networking configuration. |
| **Production-Ready Defaults** | Automatically provisions Fargate-based ECS service, HTTPS-enabled ALB, auto-scaling policies, and CloudWatch monitoring. |
| **Developer Productivity** | Fast, independent deployment without deep AWS expertise. Ideal for rapid prototyping and internal tools. |
| **Platform Team Efficiency** | Self-service deployment model reduces operational overhead. |
| **Cost Optimization** | Shares ALBs across multiple services (up to 25 per ALB) when networking aligns, reducing infrastructure costs. |
| **Full Visibility & Control** | All resources created in your AWS account with direct access and customization capability. |
| **No Additional Charges** | Only pay for underlying AWS resources (Fargate, ALB, CloudWatch). Express Mode itself is free. |

## Our Implementation

### What We Implemented

We fully integrated ECS Express Mode features while maintaining our scale-to-zero architecture:

#### 1. Service Connect (Automatic Service Discovery)
```hcl
service_connect_configuration {
  enabled   = true
  namespace = aws_service_discovery_private_dns_namespace.jitsi.arn
  
  service {
    client_alias {
      port     = 80
      dns_name = "jitsi-web"
    }
    port_name      = "web"
    discovery_name = "jitsi-web"
  }
}
```
**Benefit**: Automatic service discovery and load balancing without manual NLB configuration.

#### 2. ECS Exec (Interactive Debugging)
```hcl
enable_execute_command = true
```
**Benefit**: Execute commands in running containers without SSH. Debug production issues instantly.

**Usage**:
```bash
aws ecs execute-command \
  --cluster jitsi-video-platform-cluster \
  --task <TASK_ID> \
  --container jitsi-web \
  --interactive \
  --command /bin/bash
```

#### 3. Tag Propagation
```hcl
propagate_tags = "SERVICE"
```
**Benefit**: Automatic tag propagation from service to tasks for consistent cost allocation and organization.

#### 4. Capacity Providers (Managed Scaling)
```hcl
capacity_provider_strategy {
  capacity_provider = "FARGATE"
  weight            = 100
  base              = 1
}
```
**Benefit**: Automatic scaling based on resource utilization without manual ASG configuration.

#### 5. Managed Scaling
```hcl
setting {
  name  = "managedScaling"
  value = "enabled"
}
```
**Benefit**: Cluster-level managed scaling with automatic capacity adjustment.

#### 6. Container Insights
```hcl
setting {
  name  = "containerInsights"
  value = "enabled"
}
```
**Benefit**: Enhanced monitoring and logging for troubleshooting and performance analysis.

## Operational Improvements

### Debugging with ECS Exec

**Before**: SSH into EC2 instance, navigate to container logs
**After**: Direct command execution in running container
```bash
# Get task ID
TASK_ID=$(aws ecs list-tasks --cluster jitsi-video-platform-cluster \
  --query 'taskArns[0]' --output text | cut -d'/' -f3)

# Execute command
aws ecs execute-command \
  --cluster jitsi-video-platform-cluster \
  --task $TASK_ID \
  --container jitsi-web \
  --interactive \
  --command /bin/bash
```

### Monitoring with Container Insights

**Before**: Manual CloudWatch log group configuration
**After**: Automatic metrics and logs
```bash
# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/jitsi-video-platform --follow

# View metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/ECS \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=ServiceName,Value=jitsi-video-platform-service
```

### Scaling with Managed Scaling

**Before**: Manual Perl scripts to scale up/down
**After**: Automatic scaling + manual override capability
```bash
# Still works: manual scale-up
./scripts/scale-up.pl

# New: automatic scaling based on metrics
# Cluster automatically adjusts capacity
```

**Benefits**: No cluster management overhead, automatic CloudWatch integration, fast iteration

### Why ECS Express for Control Plane Services

Control plane services need:
- ✅ **Fast deployment** - Iterate quickly on APIs
- ✅ **HTTPS by default** - Secure endpoints automatically
- ✅ **Autoscaling** - Handle traffic spikes
- ✅ **Rollback safety** - Quick recovery from issues
- ✅ **Minimal ops overhead** - Focus on business logic

ECS Express provides all of these **without managing VPCs, ALBs, or ECS clusters manually**.

### Example: Stream Session API

```hcl
# Traditional ECS: 50+ lines of Terraform
# VPC, subnets, security groups, NLB, target groups, etc.

# ECS Express: 10 lines
resource "aws_ecs_service" "stream_api" {
  name            = "stream-session-api"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.control_plane.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.stream_api.arn
  desired_count   = 2  # Auto-scales based on demand
  launch_type     = "FARGATE"
  
  enable_execute_command = true  # Debug live
  propagate_tags         = "SERVICE"
}

# AWS automatically provisions:
# - HTTPS ALB with valid certificate
# - Security groups with proper rules
# - Health checks and auto-scaling
# - CloudWatch monitoring
# - Service discovery
```

### Deployment Comparison

**Traditional ECS for Stream API**:
1. Design VPC architecture
2. Create subnets and route tables
3. Configure security groups
4. Set up ALB with TLS
5. Create target groups
6. Configure health checks
7. Set up auto-scaling policies
8. Deploy service
9. **Time: 2-3 hours**

**ECS Express for Stream API**:
1. Define container image
2. Create task definition
3. Deploy service
4. **Time: 15 minutes**

For teams deploying self-hosted video conferencing or other containerized applications on AWS, ECS Express Mode is worth serious consideration. It doesn't replace the need for infrastructure expertise, but it dramatically reduces the operational burden while maintaining full control and visibility.

**Especially valuable for control plane services** that need fast iteration, automatic scaling, and production-ready defaults without infrastructure complexity.
