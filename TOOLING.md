# Development Tooling & AI-Assisted Workflow

This document outlines the development tools and AI-assisted workflow used to build the Jitsi video hosting platform.

## AI-Assisted Development with Amazon Q

This project was built using **Amazon Q Developer** as the primary AI assistant, demonstrating modern AI-assisted infrastructure development practices.

### Amazon Q IDE Integration

**Setup**: Amazon Q plugin installed in IDE for real-time code assistance
- **Code Generation**: Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) generation
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation generation and updates
- **Debugging**: Real-time error analysis and resolution
- **Best Practices**: AWS security and architecture recommendations

### Amazon Q GitHub Integration

**GitHub Integration**: Connected Amazon Q to GitHub repository for automated development workflows

#### Slash Commands Used:
- `/q dev` - Automatically implement features and bug fixes via pull requests
- `/q review` - Automated code reviews with security and quality feedback
- `/q help` - Access Amazon Q Developer documentation and features

#### Workflow:
1. **Issue Creation**: Used GitHub CLI to create structured issues
2. **AI Implementation**: Added `/q dev` to issues for automatic implementation
3. **Code Review**: Amazon Q provides automated PR reviews
4. **Iteration**: Continuous improvement through AI feedback

## Command Line Tools

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)
Used for repository management and issue creation:

```bash
# Create issues with AI automation
gh issue create --title "Feature Title" --body "Description\n\n/q dev" --assignee "bryanChasko"

# Repository management
gh repo view
gh pr list
```

### AWS CLI with SSO
Multi-account AWS management with Identity Center:

```bash
# Infrastructure account (us-west-2)
aws sso login --profile jitsi-dev

# DNS/Domain account (us-east-2) 
aws sso login --profile aerospaceug-admin
```

### Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code

**Primary Tool**: Terraform for complete AWS infrastructure management

#### Project Architecture
- **Single Configuration**: All infrastructure defined in `main.tf`
- **Multi-Account**: Infrastructure (668383289911) + DNS (211125425201)
- **Scale-to-Zero**: ECS service with `desired_count = 0` for cost control
- **Security First**: IAM roles, SSL certificates, encrypted storage

#### Key Terraform Resources
```hcl
# Core Infrastructure
resource "aws_vpc" "main"                    # Custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
resource "aws_subnet" "public"                # Multi-AZ public subnets
resource "aws_security_group" "jitsi"         # Ports 443/TCP, 10000/UDP
resource "aws_lb" "jitsi"                     # Network Load Balancer
resource "aws_lb_listener" "jitsi_https_tls"  # TLS listener with certificate

# Container Platform
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "jitsi"            # Fargate cluster
resource "aws_ecs_service" "jitsi"            # Scale-to-zero service
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "jitsi"    # Jitsi container config

# Storage & Security
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "jitsi_recordings"   # Video storage
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task"            # Least privilege access
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "jitsi"   # Container logs
```

#### Terraform Workflow
```bash
# Plan with output file (recommended)
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# Multi-profile management
terraform plan -out=tfplan                    # Infrastructure account
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets ...   # DNS account

# State management
terraform state list
terraform state show aws_lb.jitsi
```

#### Cross-Account Challenges Solved
1. **SSL Certificate**: Manual DNS validation across accounts
2. **DNS Management**: Separate AWS profiles for different accounts
3. **Resource Dependencies**: Careful ordering of cross-account resources
4. **State Isolation**: Infrastructure state separate from DNS state
