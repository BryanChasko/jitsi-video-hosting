# GitHub Issues for Jitsi Platform Completion

## Issue 1: Test Platform Functionality

**Title:** Test Jitsi Platform with Scale-Up and HTTPS Access

**Description:**
Test the deployed Jitsi platform by scaling up the ECS service and verifying HTTPS access.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Scale ECS service from 0 to 1: `aws ecs update-service --cluster jitsi-video-platform-cluster --service jitsi-video-platform-service --desired-count 1 --profile jitsi-dev`
- [ ] Verify service starts successfully and passes health checks
- [ ] Test HTTPS access at `https://meet.awsaerospace.org`
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is valid and trusted
- [ ] Test basic Jitsi Meet functionality (create/join room)
- [ ] Scale back to 0 after testing: `--desired-count 0`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Platform accessible via HTTPS without certificate warnings
- Jitsi Meet interface loads correctly
- Can create and join video conference rooms
- Service scales up/down successfully
