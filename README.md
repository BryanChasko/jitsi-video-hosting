# On-Demand Video Platform: Requirements & Architectural Goals

Vision and architectural goals for a video conferencing platform to serve the New England 3D (NE3D) Blender and Rio Grande Corridor Cloud Community (RGC3) AWS user groups. The solution is built leveraging 100% free Jitsi Meet open-source experience while prioritizing cost control through on-demand operation to spin down resources when calls are not in progress. Recorded video to be stored in s3 for future editing.

## Getting Started

üìã **[AWS_SETUP.md](AWS_SETUP.md)** - Complete AWS IAM Identity Center setup guide for deploying your own Jitsi platform

üåê **[DOMAIN_SETUP.md](DOMAIN_SETUP.md)** - DNS and SSL certificate configuration guide

üîß **[OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md)** - Project-specific operational details (AWS account, region, etc.) - *Not included in public repo*

‚úÖ **Infrastructure Status**: Fully deployed with HTTPS-enabled Network Load Balancer, DNS configured, and scale-to-zero ECS service

Generally speaking, this aims to be a guide others can use to host video calls and enable streaming for their own communities, hosted on AWS.

```

## Service Endpoint

The platform is to be accessible at the following publicly registered domain:
**`https://meet.awsaerospace.org`**

## Jitsi Application Requirements (The "What")

The chosen hosting platform must satisfy the following technical requirements necessary for a fully functional, secure Jitsi Meet deployment:

| Component | Required Ports | Protocol | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Interface** | 443 | TCP | Mandatory for secure browser access (HTTPS). |
| **Media (JVB)** | 10000 | UDP | **Critical.** Must be open to the internet for direct media transmission. |
| **Internal Communication** | N/A | Localhost | Internal components must be able to communicate via the host network interface (localhost). |
| **TLS/Encryption** | 443 | TLS | A valid, public SSL/TLS certificate for the domain is required. |

## Architectural & Operational Goals (The "How")

Any deployed solution must meet the following operational and cost management objectives:

### Cost Control & Scale-to-Zero

* **Goal:** Scale to zero operational cost when the platform is not in use.
* **Requirement:** The core application compute must be able to scale down to **zero running instances** and back up rapidly to align with scheduled events.
* **Control:** A **deterministic control plane** must be implemented to manage the scale-up (`start`) and scale-down (`stop`) actions.

### Security & Management

* **Developer Access:** Access must be managed using an **Identity Center / SSO** flow, eliminating long-lived access keys.
* **Secrets:** All application secrets must be stored in a dedicated, secure secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager).
* **Target Region:** All core infrastructure must be deployed in the **US West (Oregon) - `us-west-2`** region.

## Developer Guidance: Effective Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Workflow

Use these guidelines to ensure the generated code is accurate and aligns with all project requirements, keeping the entire file structure in mind.

| Infrastructure Goal | Required Context | IaC/GitOps Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Networking** | Entire project files (VPC, Subnet, Security Groups) | Define the necessary Terraform files for the VPC and two public subnets as described in the requirements. |
| **Jitsi Ports** | Project requirements for Jitsi ports (443 TCP, 10000 UDP) | Implement the Network Load Balancer (NLB) resource with the correct listeners and target groups for Jitsi traffic. |
| **Cost Control** | ECS Fargate Service parameters | Write the base ECS Fargate service Terraform, ensuring the initial `desired_count` is set to **`0`** to support the scale-to-zero requirement. |
| **Security** | IAM Policy and Task Definition files | Review the generated IAM Policy for the ECS Task Role against the principle of least privilege, using the established requirements. |
